# metaTTT-Common

Code shared between server and app will be stored here. Examples include the game state, utility files, and most important Typescript definitions for the communication protocol.

generate client UUID using namespace UUID and capacitor deviceId (persisted on browsers, great)
use uuidV4 and client UUID as namespace to generate client secret (big brain uselessness)
